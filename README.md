# NewBaka

A newer version of the chat furrification script.</br>

> **This script does not work in Lua Sandbox!**</br>
> **Lua Sandbox has differently named chat remotes.**</br>
> **If you'd like to help fix that, please send in a PR!**

## What does it do?

Your chats transform from something like this:
```
Hello, world!
```
to something possibly like:
```
h-h-hello world~! mmhh~~
```
(cringe)

## Note:

This angers people if you trick them into running it.
Have fun!
